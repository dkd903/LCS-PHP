# LCS-PHP
An Implementation of various LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) Algorithms in PHP. See Readme.md for more details.

The following Algorithms have been implemented:

1. Naive recursive algorithm (as implied by theorem 15.1 page 392)
2. Recursive algorithm with memoization
3. Dynamic programming version of the algorithm
4. Quadratic-time linear-space algorithm (Hirschberg)
